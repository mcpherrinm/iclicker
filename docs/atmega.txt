# ATmega Pinout

This document contains the pinout of the ATmega8 microcontroller used in the
iClicker.

* PD3 (INT1), Pin 1
	* Pin 37 on Transceiver, SWITCH -> Y's off to the RF Switch

* PD4, Pin 2
	* Low Battery LED
	* 270 Ohm
	* Color: Red
	* Active low

* GND, Pin 3
	* Direct Connection

* VCC, Pin 4
	* L0RB, LP2985 Low Dropout Regulator with Enable Pin

* GND, Pin 5
	* Direct Connection

* VCC, Pin 6
	* Same as Pin 4

* PB6, Pin 7
	* Crystal

* PB7, Pin 8
	* Crystal

* PD5, Pin 9
	* Successful Vote Status LED
	* 270 Ohm
	* Color: Gren
	* Active low

* PD6, Pin 10
	* Failed Vote Status LED
	* 270 Ohm
	* Color: Red
	* Active low

* PD7, Pin 11
	* Power LED
	* 300 Ohm
	* Color: Blue
	* Active Low

* PB0, Pin 12
	* Q6 -> Q4, Battery Voltage Divider Power (Verification Needed!!), Pin ADC7

* PB1, Pin 13
	* Writing a 1 to this pin maintains Vcc to the device. Writing a 0 removes
	  Vcc from the device. It can only be turned back on by the user pressing
	  the ON/OFF button.
	* This is implemented through a couple of transistors such as Q7 and Q5.
	  More investigation is required to understand exactly what is going on.

* PB2, Pin 14
	* Not Connected! \o/

* PB3 (MOSI), Pin 15
	* Pin 39 on Transceiver, Serial input to RF Chip

* PB4 (MISO), Pin 16
	* Pin 38 on Transceiver, Serial output from RF Chip

* PB5 (SCK), Pin 17
	* Pin 40 on Transceiver, SPI Clock

* AVCC, Pin 18
	* VCC

* ADC6, Pin 19
	* Probably not used

* AREF, Pin 20
	* Capacitor -> GND

* GND, Pin 21
	* GND

* ADC7, Pin 22
	* Suspected Battery Voltage Read, enable Q4 to measure

* Buttons -- Pull Up
	* PC0, Pin 23
		* Diode -> Power Switch -> BVcc with Diode, prevents BVcc > Vcc and allows
		  line to be pulled down while still letting the AVR read it as an input
	
	* PC1, Pin 24
		* S2, Vote Button A -- circuit same as S3

	* PC2, Pin 25
		* S3, Vote Button B -- 2kOhm net resistance 2-1k in series, to GND

	* PC3, Pin 26
		* S4, Vote Button C -- circuit same as S3
	
	* PC4, Pin 27
		* S5, Vote Button E -- no resistors to GND
	
	* PC5, Pin 28
		* S6, Vote Button D, no resistors, to GND

* PC6, Pin 29
	* Reset line, to ISP header and else just pulled up

* PD0 (RXD), Pin 30
	* Pin 43 DClk, Transceiver Clock

* PD1 (TXD), Pin 31
	* Pin 44 Data In/Out on the Transceiver

 PD2 (INT0), Pin 32
	* Pin 46 Pattern Block of the Transceiver
